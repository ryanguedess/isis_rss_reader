							<p>While it’s tempting to take the <em>Made in China</em> text on an iPhone at face value,
								not everything that goes into making an Apple product comes from one place.</p>

						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>The iPhone’s display, for example, is made by either Samsung or LG in South Korea. The <a

									memory</a> and DRAM, on the other hand, likely come from Kioxia’s factories in
								Japan. And the Gorilla Glass that protects the screen could make its way from a Corning
								factory in the USA, Taiwan, or Japan. Apple’s A-series <a
									href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-an-soc-smartphone-chipsets-explained-1051600/">SoC</a>,

							<q>The iPhone relies on electronic components sourced from various countries, including the USA.</q>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>Apple also relies on third parties for smaller, sometimes custom-made components like

								can be sourced from large companies such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments as well as
								smaller manufacturers in Southeast Asia. Elsewhere in the world, Apple has even <a

								shortages don’t affect its ability to manufacture iPhone batteries.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>The choice of supplier matters a great deal and it’s not just for quality control reasons

						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>Apple isn’t the only consumer electronics company that has diversified outside China of
								late. Samsung and Xiaomi have found great success in other Asian countries too. The <a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Plus_One" target="_blank">China Plus
									One</a> strategy has become a popular business strategy as companies look to achieve
								lower operating costs and lower their reliance on a single region.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>Both Asian countries offer benefits to foreign investors looking to set up manufacturing
								facilities. They also offer geopolitical and economic stability — factors that severely
								affected Apple’s iPhone production in China. These bottlenecks even forced the company
								to put out a <a

							<h3>Why does Apple assemble products in Vietnam?</h3>
							<p>Vietnam is strategically located for global shipping — the country is in close geographic
								proximity to Apple’s existing <a
									href="https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-FY21-Supplier-List.pdf"
									target="_blank">supply chain footholds</a> such as China, Taiwan, Japan, and others.
								It also has free trade agreements with other East Asian countries and is a member of the
								Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Finally, Vietnam’s entire economy is
								built on exports. From agricultural products to clothing to electronics, the country has
								benefited greatly from Western companies diversifying outside China.</p>

							<q>Apple is moving a big chunk of iPad, Macbook, and Airpods production to Vietnam.</q>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>Apple is not completely new to Vietnam either — the company already assembled smaller
								products like wired EarPods in the country. And according to a source quoted by <a
									href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Vietnam-to-make-Apple-Watch-and-MacBook-for-first-time-ever"
									target="_blank">Nikkei</a>, Apple began assembling the AirPods in Vietnam in March
								2020. That was quickly followed by the higher-end <a
									href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-review-3217269/">AirPods
									Pro</a>. Now, Apple is moving a significant percentage of iPad, MacBook, and Apple
								Watch production to Vietnam too.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>The Cupertino giant plans to achieve these goals through its manufacturing partners
								Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron. According to local <a
									href="https://thanhnien.vn/11-nha-may-trong-chuoi-cung-ung-apple-da-chuyen-sang-viet-nam-post1473060.html"
									target="_blank">news reports</a>, Apple had started assembly at 11 factories run by
								various manufacturing companies in Vietnam as of early 2022. Around that time, Foxconn
								also won a license from the Vietnamese government to build a 270 million assembly plant
								in the province of Bac Giang, less than 50 miles from the capital city of Hanoi. The
								facility will reportedly have enough capacity to ship eight million laptops and tablets
								per year.</p>

							<p>India, Apple’s second favored manufacturing destination, offers strong incentives for
								local manufacturing compared to many of its neighbors. The government’s
								<em>Make in India</em> initiative has been a runaway success. In 2020, it launched a 6
								billion production-linked incentive scheme that rewards brands for setting up domestic
								manufacturing of smartphones and electronic components.</p>
						</div>

								Samsung have already joined the Make in India initiative through a combination of
								in-house and third-party manufacturing facilities. Some examples of the latter include
								Bharat FIH and Dixon Technologies, which assemble Xiaomi and Samsung smartphones.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>Given these success stories, it’s no surprise that Apple aims to follow suit. It also
								helps that its biggest partner, Foxconn, already has a strong presence in India. The
								aforementioned Bharat FIH is a subsidiary of Foxconn Technology Group.</p>

						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>Apple’s decision to move its assembly lines to India could also increase the iPhone’s
								market share in the region. Currently, India levies a 22% customs duty on imported
								smartphones. This makes the iPhone significantly more expensive in the country than in
								most Western markets.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="ad-banner -_-e in-article">
							<div></div>

						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>With local production, however, Apple can sidestep these high import fees and could pass
								on the savings to consumers. In fact, the company has already followed this strategy
								with previous-generation iPhone models, which it already assembles in the country. Even
								though the latest iPhone sells at a significant price premium in India, older models
								often get deep discounts — likely due to the aforementioned tax breaks.</p>

							<p>With the iPhone 14, Apple began assembling current-generation iPhone models in India for
								the first time. The company tapped Foxconn for the job, specifically the latter’s
								Sriperumbudur factory in the state of Tamil Nadu. However, Apple only opted to move a
								small percentage of its iPhone 14 production from China to India — an estimated 5% right
								after launch.</p>

							<p>Even with Apple’s migration to South and East Asia, the bulk of the company’s production
								facilities will remain in China. Several key electronic components are still sourced
								from the region. Moreover, China still has a great deal of manufacturing infrastructure
								already in place. However, the country’s dominance will likely shrink over time. Still,
								Apple’s existing factory partners stand to benefit either way as they will continue to

							<p>We’ve already discussed why Apple may want to shift assembly to Vietnam and India in the
								coming years. Financial forecasts expect the transition to happen sooner rather than
								later. A JPMorgan analyst <a
									href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-is-more-aggressively-relocating-production-from-china-to-india-and-vietnam--jpm-432SI-2896365"
									target="_blank">said</a> the following in a note to the company’s clients:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<div>Vietnam is emerging as the production hub for components (camera modules) and EMS
									of smaller-volume products (Apple Watch, Mac, iPads) and is already a major
									destination for AirPods manufacturing. For iPhone EMS, India appears to be the
									location of choice for diversifying the supply chain away from China.</div>
							</blockquote>
							<p>The analyst further estimated that Apple will relocate around 25% of its iPhone
								production to India and 65% of AirPods assembly to Vietnam by 2025. Other products that
								could also see some assembly move away from China include the iPad, MacBook, and Apple
								Watch.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="-_-d -_-A">
							<p>To conclude, there’s no single answer as to where the iPhone gets made. While final
								assembly only takes place in two or three countries, the iPhone’s individual components
								and raw materials come from nearly every corner of the world.</p>
